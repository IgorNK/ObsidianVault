### 1. Present a clear objective
Make the goal visible from where the player starts.
- Removes blank canvas syndrome
- Helps setup up sight lines
- Gives the player a clear objective

### 2. Motivate movement
Make the path through a section of the level not that obvious.
- Block the players sightlines
- Make them move around to gather information
- Force them to piece together a mental map

### 3. Tear down walls
Remove sections of regular geometry to break monotony, and to show the goal in a more clear way.
- Still prevents players escaping
- More visually engaging
- Opportunities to reinforce goal

### 4. Reveal information through new perspectives
Lure the player into dead ends. Make sections of level clearly apparent only when backtracking
- Create small pockets of tension
- Then resolve the tension in surprising ways
- Keep the player engaged and on their toes

### 5. One-way valve
Block off player from returning to the previous area
- Gently nudges the player forwards
- Helps prevent player from getting too lost
- Creates a more manageable play space

### 6. Present a privileged perspective
Let the player view the area from a vantage point
- Study environment and form plan from safety
- Player pushes forwards when they are ready
- Difficult to learn layout under stress

### 7. The illusion of choice
Make divergent paths through a section of the level that converge into one.
- Multiple routes that converge on a single point
- Unlikely player will see all routes
- Makes the space feel larger than it is

### 8. Attract the players attention
Make the temporary goal more visible through use of light, color and composition
- Movement will catch the players eye
- Light makes geometry easier to read
- Sound will draw the players attention

### 9. Parallaxing elements
Add things throughout the section of the level that define volume, to break the two-dimensionality. Things like support beams, furniture, columns, desks, etc.
- Provide depth cues as the player moves
- Makes it easier to judge distance
- Creates a dynamic image

### 10. Affordances communicate function
Use recognizable shapes to mark the way forward: door arches, stairs, ramps, jump platforms.
- Doors and archways afford moving into a new space
- Steps afford climbing
- Recognizable forms like these are strong attractors to players

### 11. Creating mystery
Add life to the scene with subtle animations
- Door slightly ajar tells the player it can be opened
- Door blocks view so player can't see what is behind it
- Things the player assumes exists, but can't see creates curiosity and mystery

### 12. Create short cuts
Use dead-ends from before to get the player back to the previous stage of the level from another side. Have them unlock doors, push down ladders etc.
- Allows access to earlier areas even when using one way valves
- Players like to circumnavigate challenges
- Makes space feel more accessible and believable

### 13. Pinch points
Use spaces player has to walk through as composition tools
- Control the players movement and therefore their camera
- Show the player something important
- Doesn't take control away from player

### 14. Build a vocabulary
Using similar things for similar purposes: pipes to cross chasms, jumping platforms.
- Build on ideas that you have taught the player
- Use these ideas to seed plans in players mind
- Satisfaction in both seeing these plans be subverted or play out as expected

### 15. Safety nets
Don't make areas you can't return from
- Restarts break immersion and flow
- Keep the player in the game as much as possible
- Doesn't compromise or undermine challenge

### 16. Path blockers
Have the goal just behind a grate or see-through socked door, so the player has to circumnavigate it.

### 17. Add temporary furniture
When there aren't any assets, just throw stuff around the level.
- Spaces feel larger when empty
- Art will inevitably be added to space
- Make sure your space is large enough to accomodate both gameplay and art

### 18. Problem, solution ordering
Present the player with problem first, solution next.
- Try to ensure player recognizes the problem before they find solution
- Confusing the player if they discover information out of order
- Can make puzzle feel redundant

### 19. Let the player get lost
Don't always keep the goal in clear visibility. Make spaces that are harder to navigate through.
- Getting lost creates tension in the players journey
- Finding where you are again is satisfying
- Constantly knowing where you are kills tension

### 20. Build on uneven terrain
Create the start, the end of the level, and fill in the space between with complicated terrain.
- Forces interesting architectural compromises
- Looks more natural and visually interesting
- Encourages designer to build off grid
